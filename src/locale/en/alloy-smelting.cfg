alloy-smelting-tin-glass=[item=tin-plate] Tin glass

[mod-setting-description]
alloy-smelting-create-kilns=Create special kiln entities; if unchecked, attempt to modify default furnaces instead, which may create compatibility problems with some other mods.
alloy-smelting-coke=Process [item=coal] Coal into [item=coke] Coke for smelting [item=steel] Steel and other modded metals.
alloy-smelting-more-metallurgy=Adds [item=coke] Coke to [fluid=molten-copper] molten metal recipes. Also changes [item=low-density-structure] Low density structure to require [item=coke] Coke to cast (LDS change is ignored if Iridescent Industry is present).
alloy-smelting-metallurgy=Use [item=carbon] Carbon for advanced alloy smelting in the [item=foundry] Foundry.
alloy-smelting-tin-glass=If present, glass becomes an alloy recipe in the kiln and uses Tin in the process of casting plates of glass.
